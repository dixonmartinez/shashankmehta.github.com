_Things that I use. Last updated on 18th August, 2014._

![Hardware](/images/posts/setup/1.png)

**Laptop**: I own a Dell Inspiron 15R. It costed me &#8377;47,000 in 2011. It has 4GB ram, 650GB HDD, Intel i5. Nothing extraordinary. I carry around a 1TB Seagate external HDD.

**Tablet**: I have a Nexus 7 2012 3G 32GB edition which I bought with my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151631176199203">Deloitte CCTC 2013 winnings</a>.

**Mobile**: I have a Sony Xperia U, bought in 2012. Sony gave up on it after Android 4.0. I've rooted it and I'm running 4.1 for stability. It has a 5MP camera that is, sadly, my main camera right now. I also own a dumb samsung phone for when I'm travelling and need the week long battery life.

**Audio**: I own a [Sennheiser HD439](http://en-us.sennheiser.com/on-ear-headphones-audio-hd-439). It's a closed back circumaural headphone. It has sufficient passive noise canceling. I also have a Roland Cube 20XL guitar amplifier that I use as speakers sometimes.

**DIY Electronics**: I have an [Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) rev3 board. I also have a [Cubieboard](http://cubieboard.org) that is running Android 4.1. I also own an [Intel Galileo board](http://arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified/IntelGalileo) that was given to me after I reached the finals of Intel Embedded Challenge, 2014. I'm itching to get my hands on a [Spark core](http://spark.io).

**OS**: I'm dual booting ElemetaryOS Luna and Windows 8. Elementary is my primary OS. I had been jumping distros every few months but haven't done so since trying out Elementary.

**Development**: I use [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator/) for command line fu. I spend most of my time on either terminator or browser. Some of the terminal tools that I use daily:

- Vim for all my coding
- Git for version controlling. I put nearly everything in a git repo
- [SCM Breeze](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze) for easy git
- [Axel](http://axel.alioth.debian.org/) for downloading
- [Autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump) for quickly moving around my system
- [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/) for all things pdf. I only deal with pdfs when syncing docs between my devices
- Whole lot of custom scripts
- My dotfiles are on [GitHub](http://github.com/shashankmehta/dotfiles)

A5 ruled notebook and Stabilo fine tip pens for sketching when I am working on a user interface

**Browser**: Google Chrome with the following must have extensions:

- [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en) for API development and testing
- [Better History](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-history/obciceimmggglbmelaidpjlmodcebijb) because chrome's history page sucks
- [Ghostery](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij) to block all the social nonsense
- [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) for pretty JSON
- [Last.FM scrobbler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hhinaapppaileiechjoiifaancjggfjm) because I like to track my music listening habits
- [Motivation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ofdgfpchbidcgncgfpdlpclnpaemakoj) for nothing is more motivating than to see your life pass by right in front of your eyes
- [PushBullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) for sharing stuff between my mobile devices and laptop
- [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) for offline reading
- [Workflowy](http://workflowy.com) for offline note taking


**Web Apps**: I prefer using web applications over desktop ones

- Most of Google stuff
- Google Drive for document management. Special mention because it helped me move away from Windows environment. Linux still doesn't have a half decent document suite
- [8tracks](http://8tracks.com) for super awesome, human-curated, music playlists
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) for team chat
- [Workflowy](http://workflowy.com) for note taking. I also use the android app.
- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/leostatic) for bite sized updates
- [Feedly](http://feedly.com) for RSS

**Desktop Apps**: The few desktop apps that I do use include:

- Banshee for music
- [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) for it slowly warms the colors of your screen based on the time of day. This helps me work late in the nights without straining my eyes.
- Sublime Text for those few times when I feel like moving out of vim

**Nexus 7**: This is my main consumption device. I prefer reading on tablet than on my laptop. So most of casual browsing happens on my tablet. I use the following apps the most:

- Chrome
- [Workflowy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.workflowy.android&hl=en) for note taking
- [Pocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro&hl=en) for offline reading
- [Twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=en) so that I can sleep
- [Mantano Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mantano.reader.android&hl=en) for ebook reading
- Google Play Music
- 8tracks for super awesome, human-curated, music playlists on the go
- Play Newsstand for casual reading. I wish there was something better. I don't like Flipboard and the rest either.
- [Slack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack&hl=en) for team chat on the go
- [Press](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twentyfivesquares.press&hl=en) for RSS
- Google Keep for short notes and reminders
- [Timely](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely&hl=en) for alarm. Seriously, this app is amazing. It has so many small, well thought  features that I could write an entire blog post on it
- [Astro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely&hl=en) file manager

**Xperia U**: I keep my phone super light thanks to the pathetic performance that I'd get otherwise. A more or less exhaustive list of apps on it:

- Opera Mini for compressed, faster browsing
- Twitter for in class entertainment!
- [Instagram](http://instagram.com/shashankmehta) for sharing photos
- Keep for short notes and reminders
- Whatsapp for staying in touch
