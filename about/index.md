A short and sweet version of this page is available at [about.me/shashankmehta](http://about.me/shashankmehta). If you've got time to burn, read on.

Hi, I'm Shashank Mehta! I am a final year Electronics and Communication undergraduate by degree at [IIT Roorkee](http://www.iitr.ac.in) but a software engineer by practice/interest.

I started off with PHP but now use whatever feels right like Node or Ruby. I have worked with SlimPHP, Toro, Express, Rails, Backbone, SASS etc. I can work on frontend but I prefer working on the backend. 

I code for food, MacBook Air, fast internet, noise cancelling headphones, a comfortable chair and desk. Pretty basic needs. Truly.

I interned at [Zomato](http://zomato.com) during the summer of 2014 and at [Mango Man technologies](http://teewe.in/) in summer of 2013.

I maintain a post on my Setup at [/setup](/setup). 

I maintain a projects list at [/projects](/projects).

I push most of my code to [GitHub](http://github.com/shashankmehta).

I have been member [SDSLabs](http://sdslabs.co) (Software Development Section of IIT Roorkee) and Watch Out News Agency (Official News Magazine of IIT Roorkee) since my first year in college. I went on serve as the Secretary of SDSLabs in 4th year and Chairman of Watch Out in 3rd year of college.

I have won a few hackathons with the folks at SDSLabs.

I also play squash. IIT Roorkee Squash courts is where you'll find me most evenings. I served as the Joint Secretary of Squash IITR in 3rd year of college.

I am an [HN](http://news.ycombinator.org) addict.

I am a die hard Manchester United fan at club football level and Spain fan at international football level.
