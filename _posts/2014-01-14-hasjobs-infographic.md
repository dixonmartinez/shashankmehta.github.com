Around 1st January, I was interested in finding out what skills were the most sought after ones in the Indian startup scene. For this I scraped [Hasjob](http://hasjob.co) using JS in chrome console. I analyzed 560 posts for December 2013. Here's what I found, in an infographic form made by [Chetty Arun](http://fb.com/chetty.arun.nani)
