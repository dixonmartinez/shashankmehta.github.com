The unarguable masters of college ranking like India Today, The Week, CNN IBN, TOI, Aaj Tak and how can this list be complete without the mention of the great 'India TV', rank IIT Roorkee 6th among all engineering colleges in India. Many in IITR consider themselves above all these rankings and ratings poppycock, some choose to write verbose blog posts on their one article only blogs about how IITR is even better than MIT and some simply choose to let their actions speak. Anyways, let me start talking about the stuff that you are here for before you hit Ctrl+W.

Yahoo under Marissa Mayer seems to have adopted a hack, hack, hack and some more hack at a hackathon policy. Yahoo India's Research and Development section are travelling from one 'top' IIT to another to conduct Yahoo HackU (Hack University) events. This brought them to IIT Delhi from 16th to 19th August. Since IITR did not seem to exist on their hackathon maps, SDSLabs contacted them with the request to visit IITR also. _(For the uninitiated, SDS is the Software Development Section of IITR and SDSLabs is the core team that manages this section apart from creating applications for the betterment of our college)_. Yahoo turned down the request with the comment that they only go to 'top 5 IITs'. BUT they allowed us one team in IITD version. Perfect window of opportunity to prove the naysayers wrong.

Now I'm not going to bore you to death with the details and timeline of the event. The curious minds can find them [here](http://in.hacku.yahoo.com/ 'Yahoo India HackU'). What I _am_ going to talk about is our experience. Team SDSLabs included [Abhay Rana](http://captnemo.in 'Abhay Rana'), [Ashwini Khare](http://ashwinikhare.in 'Ashwini Khare'), Abhishek Das and me. We demoed a hack called HackView. Decription of our app (quoted from the [Hacktrackr site](http://hacks.developer.yahoo.com/hack/iit-delhi-hacku-2012/hackview/event_3/hack_262) of Yahoo)

>Why? 
Every video chat service uses a central server for receiving and pushing updates from one person to all others. If people who are in same college try to video chat, their messages literally travels around the world before being delivered to the guy on the same network! That's simply wastage of bandwidth.

>What and How?
HackView aims to reduce the bandwidth utilization and boost speeds of a Video Chat between two or more individuals by forming a peer to peer(p2p) network between the participants using WebRTC. If the users are on the same network this results in a very fast connection.

>Features:<br />
>Video chat<br />
Text chat<br />
Collaborative Doc editing:
Markdown preview supported,
Linking to sites for relevant terms by using BOSS,
Linking to images on Flickr.<br />
Collaborative editing supported on Mobile devices like android and iPad too. 

The most succinct description that I can give for the event would be 'we ate, we coded, I slept and Ashwini played Temple Run.'
There's not much to write about the coding part. Eveything is up on [github](https://github.com/sdslabs/hackview) (Yes we simply love open source!).

When I'm asked to imagine a hackathon I dream about lots of food, drinks and beanbags! But I would be lying if I said that it was Redbull driven hacking. In fact I'd be lying even if I said it was caffeine driven hacking! Y U NO GIVE US COFFEE 24hrs YAHOO!? Anyways, the snacks provided were ok. Needless to say, we survived the ordeal. 

Something worth mentioning, IITD has this super crazy, super stupid proxy system for accessing internet. There guest wifi did not work. They could not give us temporary proxies. So we were without internet unitl a messiah in the form of a Yahoo employee lent us her Reliance NetConnect usb internet. This saved our lives!


Some apps/tech stuff that helped us:

1. [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/?ref=4f016a3) for noting down all our tasks, points, things-to-do ....
2. [GitHub](http://github.com/sdslabs): This thing was godsend for hackathon. Without git and github we wouldn't have been able to finish as much as we actually did.
3. [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2): All four of us used this for coding. 

##RESULT

You can test our app at [hackview.sdslabs.co.in](http://hackview.sdslabs.co.in). You'll need Chrome >21 or Firefox nightly build.

Our demo was perfect. I don't think we could have done it any better. We had three laptops connected. One laptop was right in front of the judges and they even played with our app during the demo. We demonstrated the collaborative editing part on an iPad also. In other words, we showed what we had created rather than talking about it. We made the most out of the 2 minutes alloted time.

Ok, no more dilly dallying about the result. We won. We were the highest scoring team and HackView was adjudged the geekiest hack. 
The most satisfying part was hearing the Yahoo people announce that Team SDSLabs was from IITR and *not* IITD. Hopefully _this_ would put IITR on their maps now. We spoke to many Yahoo employees explicitly requesting them to conduct HackU in IITR too. In fact SDSLabs has even offered to organize the IITR edition.
