			It’s pretty common to see links in HN to some course page by a professor of some top US university which has a well detailed description of the course, syllabus, reading assignments, office hours, maybe even videos and class transcripts. Sadly, this isn’t the case in IIT Roorkee. Forget about course pages, the syllabus of courses are in a PDF that’s buried deep in the institute website. Braver men than me have dared to venture in there and failed.

			Last month I read a story about a professor’s mail to his students that went viral. I can safely say this cannot happen in IITR. In my two and half years in college, I have had just one professor who has ever sent us a mail on the class' google group. One out of nearly 25.
			<br>
			There are a few exceptions. That one prof who used email to communicate is one. Other was my Computer Architecture and Processors' prof who had an immaculately maintained course page. I ended up writing a script that would shoot me a mail the moment he updated the course page. Ah, bliss!
